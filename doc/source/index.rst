====================================
Welcome to the Senlin documentation!
====================================

1 Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Senlin is a service to create and manage :term:`cluster` of multiple cloud
resources. Senlin provides an OpenStack-native REST API and a AWS
AutoScaling-compatible Query API is in plan.

This section provides a detailed documentation for the concepts and built-in
policy types.

4.2 Built-in Policy Types
-------------------------

The senlin service is released with some built-in policy types that target
some common use cases. You can develop and deploy your own policy types by
following the instructions in the :ref:`developer-guide` section.

The following is a list of builtin policy types:

   user/policy_types/affinity
   user/policy_types/deletion
   user/policy_types/load_balancing
   user/policy_types/scaling
   user/policy_types/region_placement
   user/policy_types/zone_placement

5 Usage Scenarios
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides some guides for typical usage scenarios. More scenarios
are to be added

5.1 Managing Node Affinity
--------------------------

Senlin provides an :doc:`Affinity Policy <user/policy_types/affinity>` for
managing node affinity. This section contains a detailed introduction on how
to use it.

5.2 Building AutoScaling Clusters
---------------------------------

The senlin service provides a rich set of facilities for building an
auto-scaling solution:

- *Operations*: The ``CLUSTER_SCALE_OUT``, ``CLUSTER_SCALE_IN`` operations are
  the simplest form of commands to scale a cluster. The ``CLUSTER_RESIZE``
  operation, on the other hand, provides more options for controlling the
  detailed cluster scaling behavior. These operations can be performed with
  and without policies attached to a cluster.

- *Policies*:
  The ``senlin.policy.scaling`` (:doc:`link <user/policy_types/scaling>`) policy
  can be applied to fine tune the cluster scaling operations.
  The ``senlin.policy.deletion`` (:doc:`link <user/policy_types/deletion>`)
  policy can be attached to a cluster to control how nodes are removed from a
  cluster.
  The ``senlin.policy.affinity`` (:doc:`link <user/policy_types/affinity>`)
  policy can be used to control how node affinity or anti-affinity can be
  enforced.
  The ``senlin.policy.region_placement``
  (:doc:`link <user/policy_types/region_placement>`) can be applied to scale a
  cluster across multiple regions.
  The ``senlin.policy.zone_placement``
  (:doc:`link <user/policy_types/zone_placement>`) can be enforced to achieve
  a cross-availability-zone node distribution.

- *Receivers*: The receiver (:doc:`link <user/receivers>`) concept provides a
  channel to which you can send signals or alarms from an external monitoring
  software or service so that scaling operations can be automated.

This section provides some guides on integrating senlin with other services
so that cluster scaling can be automated.

6.2 Built-in Policy Types
-------------------------

Senlin provides some built-in policy types which can be instantiated and then
attached to your clusters. These policy types are designed to be orthogonal so
that each of them can be used independently. They are also expected to work
in a collaborative way to meet the needs of complicated usage scenarios.

6.3 Reviewing Patches
---------------------

There are many general guidelines across the community about code reviews, for
example:

- `Code review guidelines (wiki)`_
- `OpenStack developer's guide`_

Besides these guidelines, senlin has some additional amendments based on daily
review experiences that should be practiced.
